# Documenting a Learning Curve

Webdesign-related blogposts [hosted here on Github](http://atelierbram.github.io/blog/): a place to conveniently post some of the things I learn along the way with `HTML`, `CSS` and `Javascript`. Most of these articles were also published on [Codepen](http://codepen.io/atelierbram/blog), _(to subscribe to the RSS-feed, please <a href="http://codepen.io/atelierbram/blog/feed/">grab the feed on Codepen</a>)_.

### Template and Design
This blog runs on [Assemble](http://assemble.io), the static-site generator, which is [awesome and fun to use](http://atelierbram.github.io/blog/assembling).
It was generated from a template called [Flex-Starter](http://github.com/atelierbram/flex-starter), which in turn is based on [build-boilerplate](https://github.com/atelierbram/build-boilerplate), which in turn is a fork of [static-site-boilerplate](https://github.com/bdadam/static-site-boilerplate) by Adam Beres-Deak, with some modifications:

- Sass instead of Less
- different Javascript workflow
- adapted Gruntfile.js file
