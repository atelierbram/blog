# [Documenting a Learning Curve](http://atelierbram.github.io/blog/)

Webdesign-related blogposts [hosted here on Github](http://atelierbram.github.io/blog/): a place to conveniently post some of the things I learn along the way with `HTML`, `CSS` and `Javascript`. Most of these articles were also published on [Codepen](http://codepen.io/atelierbram/blog), you can  _[subscribe to the RSS-feed](http://codepen.io/atelierbram/blog/feed/) there_.

### Template and Design
This blog runs on [Assemble](http://assemble.io), the static-site generator, which is [awesome and fun to use](http://atelierbram.github.io/blog/assembling).
It was generated from a template called [Flex-Starter](http://github.com/atelierbram/flex-starter), which in turn is based on [build-boilerplate](https://github.com/atelierbram/build-boilerplate), which in turn is a fork of [static-site-boilerplate](https://github.com/bdadam/static-site-boilerplate) by Adam Beres-Deak, with some modifications.
